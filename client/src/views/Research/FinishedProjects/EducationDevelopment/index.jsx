        A book titled An Overview of Education Development in the Arab Region:

        is released by SLIBNU-ALECSO â€˜Smart Educationâ€™ Joint Lab. The book is an
        outcome of Open Interactive Database Project, in collaboration between

        Authored by Dejian Liu, Mohamed Jemni, Ronghuai Huang, Yiping Wang,
        Ahmed Tlili and Salah Sharhan, this book aims to provide a comprehensive
        understanding of the education development in the Arab region. Important
        issues, such as education access and inclusiveness, were highlighted.
        The book reveals that major efforts have been made by many Arab
        countries, especially those in Sub-Saharan Africa, over the past decade
        to improve education access. In terms of education inclusiveness, the
        authors found that gender disparity in primary and secondary education
        usually favors males. However, in most Arab countries, gender disparity
        in higher education favors females.

        Several challenges in education are identified in the book. For
        instance, in many Arab countries universal primary education has not
        been achieved, the education expenditure is inadequate, and the quality
        of education needs to be improved. The book also illustrates how
        conflicts in the Arab region can cause deterioration in education. The
        authors suggest that to face these challenges and improve access and
        quality of education in the Arab region, international collaboration,
        integration of next generation information technology and utilization of
        Open Education Resources (OER) are necessary.
