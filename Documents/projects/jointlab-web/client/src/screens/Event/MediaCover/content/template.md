Mr. Xiaobing Li pointed out that BNU had always regarded “educational innovation” as one of the pillars, attaching great importance to the design on future education. The aim of the Competition, which has been held consecutively for four years, is to help the society rethink and rebuild future education. Mr. Zuoyu Zhou expressed that BNU was willing to accumulate innovative achievements in education across the world, as well as gain help from educational, scientific and design community to improve those achievements by hosting the Competition as a communication platform for innovative talents. Mr. Mohamed Jemni believed that digital technology would be a key player in future education. With the outbreak of COVID-19, technological support has become a foreground for resuming educational activities in all countries. In this case, the emergence of the fourth industrial revolution, block chain, cloud computing will certainly promote future education in a broad way.

This year, the Competition adds another catalogue which is for teachers, hoping to show how primary and secondary school teachers depict future education by accumulating teachers’ case-studies across the globe. Also, from the perspective of college students, they provide us with practical and well-designed projects on future education. All participants explore innovative solutions to achieve inclusive education with the means of cloud design, meeting the needs of personalized education, special education, rural education and education in crisis. Awards-winning projects cover different subjects and areas: some focus on The Belt & Road Initiative inter-disciplinary study to provide comprehensive course design; some design courses under the background of the pandemic; some pay attention to the lack of educational resources in rural areas; some try to meet the needs of special children, etc. The excellent projects keep popping out, all of which are innovative and practical.

Mr. Ronghuai Huang, Co-Dean of Smart Learning Institute of BNU, stressed that the original aim of the Competition was to integrate design into education. As participants have shown more problem awareness, the Competition has seen fruitful results in terms of the integrity of projects and application prospect. In the future, global cooperation will be further strengthened, the Competition themes will be diversified and excellent projects in the Competition will be published so as to wield greater influence in the world.
